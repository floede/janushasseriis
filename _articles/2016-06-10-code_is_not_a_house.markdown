Writing code is not like building a house

At my first job as a webdesigner, we had a client who sold special sodas. This was when making a website meant ftp’ing flat HTML and images to a server. And then it just worked :-)
Anyway, almost fresh out of school I had the task to update his website with new products. 
One day he called me to talk about some changes he wanted made. As I recall it was one of those “the stuff you’ve made is not quite what I wanted, so I want you to change it again” conversations.
And even though I had nothing to do with billing, he also complained to me that he had to pay half upfront.
I tried to explain that it’s quite standard and necessary in creative line of work. That half or more of the time spend goes into the first draft. So if that gets rejected, that time is lost.
And his reply was: “When I order some sodas, I can check the quality when they arrive. And if I don’t like it, I can send them back.”

I didn’t quite know how to respond to that logic.
I guess I could have told him that a website is like a house. That once it’s built, it takes time and effort (aka money) to change things.

Of course, now I know that a website is not at all like a house.

I’ve worked on several big projects. Many of those went over budget or past their deadline. A few saw us deploying code that I was nowhere near proud of, and some had people working overtime to meet the deadline.

Of course not all projects ended badly but a lot did and nobody remembers the ones that go well. 
In projects and especially in IT projects we talk about the product management triangle which is the triangle of cost, time and scope, where scope means quality and features. The general concept is that you can’t have all 3. You can pick any two but the last one will be determined over the course of the project. 
The classic scenario is getting a website done for a deadline. That means scope and time has been set. But the team is behind schedule, so they add more people or work over time. So the cost goes up. Or they cut features. Or miss the deadline.

But why is that?
Why can’t we agree on a design and some features with a client, and then just build it in the allotted time?
Most of us are professionals, we should be able to reasonably estimate a project. We build websites all the time, yet it feels like we’re starting over each time.


I’m not a craftsman, but it seems to me that with experience and expertise a crew of workers can build a house without blowing the budget or deadline completely. It doesn't even have to be the same house
But for the web we can't do that, or we can. But then it's the exact same website. Then it's a CMS, it’s WordPress or Squarespace.

Clients often say they just want the standard site, and then it turns out they want something new and shiny. And who can blame them. There’s always somebody living on the bleeding edge, showing the rest of us all the cool things you can do with technology.
And let’s be honest, that’s why we’re developers. Because we like to try our hands at the new and shiny.

But it’s expensive to build something when you don’t know exactly how.

New ways to look at projects even suggests that while building a house can be said to be complicated, but predictable. Software development will always be complex with unknown challenges.

And thus we can’t approach a website project with the mindset we would have if we we’re building a house.
