I've been doodling and drawing my whole life, but never anything serious. Started working as a webdesigner in 1999, as I figured I could use my creative energy to build websites.

Now we call what I do Frontend Developer, and for me it means I focus on HTML, CSS, UX, semantic and responsive sites plus agile development.

Lately I've started thinking it about why it's so hard to manage website projects.
